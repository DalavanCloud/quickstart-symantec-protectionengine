## Symantec Protection Engine on AWS

Use this Quick Start to deploy Symantec Protection Engine (SPE) for Cloud Services on AWS in less than an hour.

SPE enables you to incorporate malware and threat detection technologies into your application. SPE includes Symantec's malware protection and proprietary, patented URL categorization technology. It provides fast, scalable, and reliable content scanning services to protect your data and storage systems against the ever-growing malware threat landscape.

You can integrate SPE with almost any application through the Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) by using .NET APIs for C, Java, and C#. This Quick Start aids integration with proxies such as F5, Squid, etc., and is designed for enterprise administrators who want to scan their ingress/egress traffic for viruses, trojans, and other kinds of malware.
